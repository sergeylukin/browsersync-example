# Starting point for Browsersync driven development

[![Browsersync example app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergeylukin/browsersync-example/master/extras/cover.png)](https://sergeylukin.github.io/browsersync-example/)

## About

This little web app was developed by [Sergey Lukin](http://sergeylukin.com)
([@sergey_lukin](https://twitter.com/sergey_lukin))
using [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) with a single purpose -
provide a basic starting point for anyone interested in `Browsersync`
to test it's capabilities. It was created to serve as an practical example
for a blog post released on [Code4Startup.com](https://code4startup.com/)
(link coming soon!)

Here is just a short snapshot of how Browsersync allows navigating this app
across multiple devices/browsers:

Here is a short video demo of me fixing some bugs and adding some features
using `Browsersync`:

  ```

- Connect as many devices as possible and give this small alarm clock a try :)
